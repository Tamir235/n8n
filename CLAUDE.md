# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

A collection of **n8n workflow JSON files** exported from n8n Cloud (`https://n8nconsutinginternational.app.n8n.cloud`). All "code" is n8n workflow JSON — there is no build system, no package manager, and no tests. Development means editing these JSON files locally and deploying to n8n Cloud via the REST API or UI import.

- GitHub repo: `https://github.com/Tamir235/n8n`
- n8n API base: `https://n8nconsutinginternational.app.n8n.cloud/api/v1`
- n8n API auth header: `X-N8N-API-KEY: <key from n8n Settings → API Keys>`

**Note:** The many subdirectories in this repo (`brandkit/`, `caveman/`, `skills/`, `.agents/`, etc.) are Claude Code skill files — they are not n8n workflows and should be ignored when working on the automation pipelines.

## How to Deploy Changes

```bash
# Get a workflow (find ID in table below)
curl -H "X-N8N-API-KEY: $N8N_KEY" https://n8nconsutinginternational.app.n8n.cloud/api/v1/workflows/{id}

# Update a workflow (PUT replaces entirely — always GET first)
curl -X PUT -H "X-N8N-API-KEY: $N8N_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @"workflow.json" \
  https://n8nconsutinginternational.app.n8n.cloud/api/v1/workflows/{id}

# Create a new workflow
curl -X POST -H "X-N8N-API-KEY: $N8N_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @"new-workflow.json" \
  https://n8nconsutinginternational.app.n8n.cloud/api/v1/workflows

# List all workflows
curl -H "X-N8N-API-KEY: $N8N_KEY" \
  https://n8nconsutinginternational.app.n8n.cloud/api/v1/workflows?limit=50
```

Via UI: open workflow → ⋮ menu → **Import from file**. Deactivate before import, re-activate after.

## Workflow Architecture

**Crypto and Cooking are two completely independent projects.** They do not share sub-workflows, triggers, or data flows. Both use the same external services (S3/R2, ElevenLabs, Shotstack, Telegram) but with separate S3 prefixes and separate n8n workflow IDs. Never wire them together.

### Crypto Reel System (production, runs daily 07:30 Berlin time)

| File | n8n ID | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `Reels Master.json` | `XvwKX49S493TsBlH` | Master orchestrator — generates `scriptId`, calls sub-workflows in sequence, sends social captions in parallel |
| `News Intake.json` | `pT5wAtJd57wCEBhv` | Fetches RSS from 5 sources, parses XML, scores/clusters articles, runs GPT agents, outputs `clips[]` |
| `Voice and Image Generator.json` | `1nuI2fuS22Cq5w81` | Two `SplitInBatches` loops (audio + image) run sequentially; merges results by `clipIndex` |
| `Video rendering.json` | `VeXgfkihC7JYQr26` | Builds SRT, uploads to S3, submits Shotstack render, polls for completion, delivers via Telegram + Google Drive |

### Cooking Video System (in development)

| File | n8n ID | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `Cooking — AI Food Studio Test.json` | `Qzd8tZyFb4rVPOyu` | Test/PoC — AI Director agent (GPT-4.1) converts recipe → cinematic production plan with Kling AI prompts |
| `Cooking — Recipe Intake.json` | `B2BrjjbqFhUgeHZV` | **A1 ✅** — Dual-mode: URL scrape (HTML → LangChain agent) or dish name → OpenAI gpt-4.1-mini recipe generation → normalized recipe + `scriptId` |
| `Cooking — Drehbuch Generator.json` | `9QSE0w8qgSWdlzSK` | **A2 ✅** — AI screenplay generator: recipe → full cinematic production plan (AI Food Studio v1.0, 8–12 clips, 60–90s) |
| `Cooking — Voice and Image Generator.json` | `M6FzHQY3YG7zxjjC` | **A3 ✅** — Parallel audio (ElevenLabs) + image (OpenAI gpt-image-1 high) loops for all clips; merges by clipIndex |
| `Cooking — Kling AI Animator.json` | `yndJdfRoRIJbvTLC` | **A4 ✅** — Animates each clip image into a 5–10s MP4 via Kling AI image2video; polls until done, uploads to S3, outputs `video_url` per clip. Real API key active. |
| `Cooking — Video Renderer.json` | `YRKcfHEK5qcZ3wUO` | **A5 ✅** — Builds SRT (3 words/segment) → uploads to `cooking-reels` S3 → submits Shotstack render (video+audio tracks, captions) → polls until done → downloads → delivers in parallel: S3/R2, Telegram (sendVideo), Google Drive. Intro/Outro at 0s placeholder. |
| `Cooking — Master.json` | `ZbRaldRsY68GmpgJ` | **A6 ✅** — Top-level orchestrator: Webhook trigger (POST /cooking-master) → parse input → Telegram confirm → calls A1→A2→A3→A4→A5 in sequence → sends Instagram + TikTok + YouTube Shorts captions in parallel → Pipeline Complete notification. |
| `Cooking — Error Logger.json` | `bCRPcgcAvzFMvf7j` | **Error Logger ✅** — Centralised error handler: fires via n8n Error Trigger whenever any cooking workflow fails → formats Berlin-time message with workflow name, short error, scriptId, and execution URL → sends to Telegram chat `-1003735970138`. All 6 cooking workflows (A1–A6) route their errors here. |

### The `scriptId` — correlation key across all sub-workflows

- **Crypto:** `reel_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-SSSZ` (Berlin timezone), created in Reels Master
- **Cooking:** `cooking_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-SSSZ` (Berlin timezone), created in Recipe Intake (A1)

S3/R2 asset paths are namespaced under it:
```
reels/{scriptId}/audio/clip_NN_{type}__{hash}.mp3     ← crypto
reels/{scriptId}/image/clip_NN_{type}__{hash}.png     ← crypto
reels/{scriptId}/srt/full_transcript_{ts}.srt         ← crypto

cooking/{scriptId}/audio/clip_NN_{type}.mp3              ← cooking (ElevenLabs)
cooking/{scriptId}/image/clip_NN_{type}.png              ← cooking (OpenAI gpt-image-1)
cooking/{scriptId}/video/clip_NN_{type}.mp4              ← cooking (Kling AI animated)
cooking/{scriptId}/srt/full_transcript_{ts}.srt          ← cooking
cooking/{scriptId}/final/{recipe_name}_{date}.mp4        ← cooking (Shotstack final render)
```

The crypto hash (SHA-256, 12 chars) in filenames is derived from content — enables idempotent re-runs.

## Inter-Workflow Data Contract

Each sub-workflow is called via `executeWorkflow` with `waitForSubWorkflow: true`. The data shape that flows between them:

**A1 → A2 (Recipe Intake → Drehbuch Generator):**
```json
{
  "scriptId": "cooking_2026-06-28T07-30-00-000Z",
  "recipe": {
    "name": "Beef Wellington",
    "servings": 2,
    "prepTime": "30 min",
    "cookTime": "45 min",
    "ingredients": ["500g Rinderfilet", "..."],
    "steps": ["Fleisch würzen", "..."]
  }
}
```

**A2 → A3 (Drehbuch → Voice + Image Generator):**
```json
{
  "scriptId": "cooking_...",
  "recipe_name": "Beef Wellington",
  "clips": [
    {
      "clipIndex": 0,
      "act": "hook",
      "duration_seconds": 5,
      "voiceover_text": "Dieses saftige Beef Wellington...",
      "kling_prompt": "Emma from Project Bible. Scandinavian Kitchen...",
      "camera": "close-up",
      "lens": "85mm",
      "continuity_note": "...",
      "transition_out": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**A3 → A4 (Voice+Image → Kling Animator):** adds `audio_url` and `image_url` per clip, preserves `kling_prompt`.

**A4 → A5 (Kling → Renderer):** adds `video_url` per clip (Kling `.mp4`), preserves `audio_url`.

**Crypto clip shape** (News Intake → Voice and Image Generator):
```json
{
  "scriptId": "reel_...",
  "clips": [
    { "type": "market_overview", "voiceover": "...", "image_prompt": "..." }
  ]
}
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Video Rendering (crypto)
`build srt file` generates `.srt` at 3 words/segment. Timing comes from ElevenLabs `alignment.character_end_times_seconds`. Falls back to `calcDuration()` (words/2.35 + linguistic complexity heuristics) if duration is missing. Shotstack polling: 30s initial wait → check → 10s retry loop. Delivery to Telegram and Google Drive runs in parallel.

### AI Food Studio Director (cooking A2)
The Drehbuch Generator agent uses a locked character (Emma, 28, European, white cotton shirt, beige linen apron) and a fixed Scandinavian kitchen that must be identical across all clips. Every Kling AI prompt follows a strict 13-block architecture: Project Bible reference → Scene → Food Details → Hand Movement → Camera → Lens → Focus → Light → Atmosphere → Video Style → Continuity → Transition → Negative Prompt.

Known agent output bugs (both fixed in A2 spec):
- `total_duration_seconds` is estimated, not summed — must be computed as `Σ clip.duration_seconds`
- Complex recipes may skip steps — a completeness gate must verify all recipe steps appear in `clips[]`

### Intro/Outro (crypto, hardcoded in `Intro/Outro` Set node)
```
intro_length: 7.5s  |  outro_length: 8.5s  |  captions_enabled: true
```
Assets at `reels/Intro/` and `reels/Outro/` in the CDN.

### Intro/Outro (cooking, configurable in `Intro/Outro Config` Set node in A5)
```
intro_length: 0s  |  outro_length: 0s  (placeholders — set to 0 until real assets available)
```
When assets are ready: upload to `cooking/Intro/` and `cooking/Outro/` in CDN, then update the Set node with URLs and lengths. Shotstack uses `type: "video"` with `volume: 0` for video track + separate audio track (same pattern as main clips).

## Error Handling

All 6 cooking workflows (A1–A6) are configured with `settings.errorWorkflow = "bCRPcgcAvzFMvf7j"` (Cooking — Error Logger). When any of them fails, n8n automatically triggers the Error Logger, which:

1. Reads `$json.workflow.name`, `$json.execution.url`, `$json.error.message`, and `$json.error.stack` from the trigger payload.
2. Tries to extract a `cooking_*` scriptId from the error text (regex `/cooking_[\w\-]+/`).
3. Formats a German Telegram message with Berlin timestamp (Europe/Berlin timezone via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`).
4. Sends the message to Telegram chat `-1003735970138` using credential `XSt2NLTZQtZZSEYL`.

The redundant `Send Error Notification` node that was in A6 (Cooking — Master) but was never wired to any error path has been removed.

Covered workflows:

| Workflow | n8n ID |
|---|---|
| A1 — Recipe Intake | `B2BrjjbqFhUgeHZV` |
| A2 — Drehbuch Generator | `9QSE0w8qgSWdlzSK` |
| A3 — Voice + Image Generator | `M6FzHQY3YG7zxjjC` |
| A4 — Kling AI Animator | `yndJdfRoRIJbvTLC` |
| A5 — Video Renderer | `YRKcfHEK5qcZ3wUO` |
| A6 — Master | `ZbRaldRsY68GmpgJ` |

## Open Issues

| Issue | Detail |
|---|---|
| **B3** | Parallelize two sequential `SplitInBatches` loops in Voice and Image Generator — split before, merge after by `clipIndex` |
| **A1** | `SPOONACULAR_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER` no longer needed — branch replaced with OpenAI AI generation. Resolved. |
| **A5 Intro/Outro** | `intro_length` and `outro_length` set to 0 in `Intro/Outro Config` node — upload real cooking intro/outro video+audio assets to S3 and update URLs |
| **Error Handling** | ✅ Resolved — Error Logger (`bCRPcgcAvzFMvf7j`) active; all 6 cooking workflows point to it via `settings.errorWorkflow`. |
